    An "iteration" is bounded by ASSISTANT messages:

    - Each ASSISTANT message starts a new iteration
    - USER or FRAMEWORK messages immediately before the ASSISTANT are part of that iteration (optional)

    This strategy preserves:
    1. System prompt (if keep_system=True)
    2. All user/assistant/framework messages (in full)
    3. Tool results in the last N iterations (in full, controlled by keep_iterations)
